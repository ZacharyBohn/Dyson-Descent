Working Title: Starfall: Dyson Descent

⸻

1. Core Premise

Ancient civilizations constructed Dyson spheres that fully converted their stars into stable, contained energy matrices. The civilization vanished. The spheres remain operational.

Each sphere is guarded by autonomous drones powered by the stored stellar energy and governed by a central AI residing at the core.

The player operates from a neutral hub station and sends disposable quantum clones of their ship into these spheres to extract resources and uncover the truth.

2. Core Pillars
	1.	Radial Descent Structure – Depth = moving inward toward the core.
	2.	Predictable Systems – Drones patrol fixed routes and use deterministic attack patterns.
	3.	Risk-Based Extraction – Manual return preserves more resources.
	4.	Fuel as Strategic Constraint – Primarily affects extraction and open-world traversal.
	5.	Open Roam Economy Loop – Mining and exploration fund progression.

3. Structure of a Dyson Sphere (Dungeon)

Each sphere is divided into concentric layers:

Layer 1 – Collector Array
	•	Massive solar collectors and debris fields.
	•	Open combat space.
	•	Light environmental hazards.
	•	Basic patrol drones.

Layer 2 – Industrial Refinement Ring
	•	Energy conversion machinery.
	•	Narrow corridors and moving structures.
	•	Denser drone patrols.
	•	Environmental damage zones.

Layer 3 – Containment Lattice
	•	High radiation fields.
	•	Gravity distortions.
	•	Plasma conduits.
	•	Coordinated drone responses.

Layer 4 – Core (AI Nexus)
	•	Abstract geometry.
	•	Reality-distorting spaces.
	•	Elite defensive constructs.
	•	AI confrontation encounter.

Each layer has:
	•	Entry gate checkpoint.
	•	Locked forward progression.
	•	Return snaps player to start of current layer.

⸻

4. Run Structure
	•	Player creates a quantum clone of ship + pilot.
	•	Clone is transmitted into a sphere.
	•	Run ends when:
	•	Ship is destroyed (partial data recovery).
	•	Player manually extracts (greater rewards retained).

No physical backtracking required between layers.

Run duration target: 30–60 minutes.

5. AI Drone Design

Design goal: High predictability, skill-based mastery.

Behavior Principles
	•	Fixed patrol paths.
	•	Deterministic attack cycles.
	•	Telegraphs before firing.
	•	No randomness in movement.

Difficulty scales by:
	•	Patrol density.
	•	Overlapping fields of fire.
	•	Environmental hazard layering.
	•	Coordinated formations in deeper layers.

Player mastery comes from:
	•	Pattern recognition.
	•	Route optimization.
	•	Heat management.
	•	Spatial positioning.

⸻

6. Combat System
	•	Infinite ammo.
	•	Weapons generate heat.
	•	Overheating temporarily weakens systems.
	•	Certain weapons destabilize energy structures.

Combat emphasis:
	•	Movement precision.
	•	Heat discipline.
	•	Environmental awareness.

No ammo scarcity — complexity comes from positioning and timing.

⸻

7. Fuel System

Fuel is used for:
	1.	Open-world travel.
	2.	High-thrust maneuvers.
	3.	Emergency extraction.

Inside spheres:
	•	Normal movement costs minimal fuel.
	•	Extraction consumes significant fuel.
	•	Deeper layers increase extraction cost.

If fuel depletes:
	•	Only sublight engines available.
	•	Extraction becomes slow and vulnerable.

Fuel functions as exit insurance, not moment-to-moment limiter.

⸻

8. Open Roam Layer

Outside spheres:

Activities:
	•	Asteroid mining.
	•	Derelict exploration.
	•	Rogue defense fragments.
	•	Resource harvesting.

Asteroids provide:
	•	Minerals.
	•	Exotic isotopes.
	•	Technology fragments.

Resources convert to:
	•	Credits.
	•	Ship upgrades.
	•	Clone improvements.

Exploration tone comparable to the scale freedom of No Man’s Sky, but combat-centric.

⸻

9. Progression

Persistent upgrades include:

Ship:
	•	Increased cargo capacity.
	•	Larger fuel tanks.
	•	Heat dissipation.
	•	Engine efficiency.

Clone:
	•	Improved data recovery on destruction.
	•	Layer skip unlocks.
	•	Signal dampeners to reduce drone coordination.

Long-term objectives:
	•	Breach deeper layers.
	•	Reach core AI.
	•	Determine cause of civilization extinction.

⸻

10. Central AI
	•	Cold, directive-driven intelligence.
	•	Believes system remains functional.
	•	Treats player as structural anomaly.
	•	Controls deeper layer coordination.

Endgame involves:
	•	Disabling.
	•	Negotiating.
	•	Or exploiting the core energy matrix.

11. Game Loop

Outer Loop
	1.	Open roam.
	2.	Gather resources.
	3.	Upgrade ship and clone.

Inner Loop
	1.	Clone deployment.
	2.	Descend inward through layers.
	3.	Collect high-value materials.
	4.	Extract or be destroyed.
	5.	Improve and repeat.

⸻

12. Design Tone
	•	Clean, mechanical, deterministic.
	•	Less chaos, more mastery.
	•	Skill comes from learning systems.
	•	Depth equals commitment and increasing environmental hostility.

⸻

This establishes:
	•	Clear dungeon metaphor via radial descent.
	•	Predictable enemy philosophy.
	•	Strong risk-reward loop.
	•	Expandable progression system.
	•	Scalable endgame centered on AI core.
